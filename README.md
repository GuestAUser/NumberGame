# NumberGame

## Simple number game in python I found lost in my usb stick, made it as a child with my dad but I updated most of the code tho, like the animation that is recent, this is just a way for me to go back to coding, it was fun and any help for optimizing the code or add ideias would be great!

### **If you're gonna use this code for any reason at all, link to my github page so people can see my other projects to come!**





***ALSO THIS CODE CURRENTLY IS FOR LINUX TERMINALS ONLY, sorry windows user's :/***
